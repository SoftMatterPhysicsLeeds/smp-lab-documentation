Stelar FFC NMR 
==============

Hardware Setup
--------------

1. Turn on the Galden recirculator
2. If compressed air supply isn't on already, open valve.
3. If the PC isn't on already, press orange 'Reset computer array' button
4. Press green TX button (should light up and fan should start). 

5. Sample Setup

    a. Add white 'tube holder' to sample tube and centre your sample using the block on the side of the machine. 
    b. Place sample into magnet (place into hole in the top)
    c. Place weight over tube above white holder to stop the tube floating in the compressed air. 

6. Switch on VTC 90 (temperature controller)
    a. Press RESET then 1 then ENTER (within a couple of seconds). 
    b. The display should now read "Flow = 300". Press enter (don't change the flow)
    c. Enter desired starting temperature. 

Software Setup
--------------
1. Load "ACQNMR" software (link on Desktop)
2. Navigate to Hardware => Magnet => Switch On. 
3. Right click "Not Connected" (top right) and click "Connect". You should see the front panel of the VTC unit replicated in this box. You can now change the sample temperature by right clicking this box and selecting 'Set Point'.

Measurement Setup: Correcting the frequecy offset, F1.
------------------------------------------------------
You should perform these steps every time you change sample/temperature.

1. On the ‘Main Par’ tab, select ‘EXP’ and choose ‘NP’ (we are going to use this 1 pulse sequence to set frequency and phasing).
2. Relaxation Field 7MHz.
3. File, New File Name.
4. Recycle delay to 5T1 in the ‘Main par’ tab (if you don't know T1, choose 1s). 
5. If desired, change the number of scans in the ‘Acq. Par – Basic’ tab. 1-4 is usually sufficient.
6. Delay tau to 5T1 (if you don't know T1, choose 1s). 
7. Click on the GUN to start the measurement 
8. Click the Save icon.
9. Click Correct F1 button.

Measurement Setup: Measuring R1/T1 spectrum at 7MHz.
----------------------------------------------------

1. Change experiment to "NP/S" on the Main tab. 
2.
