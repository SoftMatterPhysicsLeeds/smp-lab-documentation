# 3D Photon Correlation Spectrometer
Author: Dan Baker

## :construction: Work in progress! :construction:

The following procedure is for running the LS Instruments 3D Photocorrelation Spectrometer in 3.08.

## Initial setup

1. Turn on the laser.
2. Turn on both control boxes.
3. Turn on both switches for the water bath (controller and bath).
4. Turn on PC (if it isn't already).
5. Start the measurement software (make sure nothing is blocking the sample goniometer from moving)

## Load the sample

!!! note
    Samples should either be put into 10mm diameter 'culture tubes' or 5mm NMR tubes. They should be filled to ~10mm up the tube so that the laser passes through the sample

1. Clean the outside of the sample tube with IPA on a lint-free cloth (make sure you wear nitrile gloves to do this).
2. Insert the tube into the relevant holder. For the 10mm tube holder, push the sample down so that the lid sits flush with the top of the holder. 
3. Check that the laser passes through the sample: turn the laser intensity control from 'Auto' to 'Set Laser Intensity' and change this to something small (1% for example) and have a look at the scattered light through the sample VAT window. It should look like a continuous red line through the sample. If it's diffuse then your sample is probably too concentrated. If the path deviates then it's likely hitting the meniscus at the top of the sample so you either need to put more sample in the tube or reseat the tube in the holder. 

## Perform initial test measurement

1. Set the sample goniometer to 90Â°. 
2. Set the laser intensity setting to 'Auto'. 
3. Set the temperature. 
4. Make sure the tube setting is correct for your sample. 
5. Go to Measurement tab and click start measurement.
