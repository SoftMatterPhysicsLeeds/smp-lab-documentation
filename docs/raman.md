    Click [here](#laser-power-at-sample) for measurements of laser power at the sample position 

## Initial setup

1. Turn on the spectrometer box using the switch on the right-hand-side.
2. Turn on the PC. 
3. Load WiRE and select 'Reference all motors'. Wait for the software to load completely. 
4. Turn laser on by turning the laser key 45Â° clockwise.


## Laser power at sample

The following are power readings of the incident laser at the sample position with various objectives, measured using a [Thorlabs S120C](https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=S120C) sensor. The laser power for our system is 50mW. The 'power setting' column refers to the neutral density filter setting in WiRE (control software). Units of power readings are in mW.
