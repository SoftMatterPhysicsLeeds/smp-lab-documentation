# Vacuum Ovens

## :construction: Work in progress! :construction:


## Loading

1. Open the oven door by turning the handle anti-clockwise until it stops. 
2. Put your sample on a shelf in the oven. 
3. Close the door by shutting it and turning the handle clockwise until it stops.
4. Make sure that the 'vent' and 'vacuum' valves are completely closed (clockwise until stop).
5. Switch the oven on (if it isn't already). 
6. Turn the vacuum pump on. 
7. Open the vacuum valve on the splitter manifold for the orange tubing. 
8. Slowly open the vacuum valve on the oven (turn anti-clockwise). The vacuum gauge will start decreasing.

    !!! warning
        If you hear a lot of hissing air at this point, turn off the pump, close all valves and make sure there is nothing obstructing the door.

9. When the vacuum gauge has stopped decreasing (usually ~-27), close the vacuum valve on the oven. 
10. Close vacuum valve on the splitter manifold.
11. Turn off the pump.
12. Set temperature by pressing the up/down arrows on the temperature controller.

## Unloading

!!! warning
    It is important that you turn on the pump and pump the oven down again before you open the door so that anything that has evaporated from your sample is removed by the pump. 

1. Turn on the vacuum pump. 
2. Open the vacuum valve on the splitter manifold. 
3. Open the vacuum valve on the oven.
4. Pump out the oven for a few minutes or until the vacuum gauge falls back to the value it reached when you set the oven up. 
5. Close the vacuum valve on the oven.
6. Close the vacuum valve on the splitter manifold. 
7. Turn off the vaccum pump. 
8. Slowly open the 'vent' on the oven. The vacuum gauge should slowly increase back to 0 (atmospheric pressure). 
9. When the vacuum gauge reads 0, open the door of the oven by turning the handle anti-clockwise until it stops. 
10. Remove your sample. 

!!! danger
    Your sample might be hot!
