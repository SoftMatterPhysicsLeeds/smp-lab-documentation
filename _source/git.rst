This document will explain how to set up a git repository and the process for storing this repository on Github. It is not meant to be completely exhaustive (I'm definitely not an expert) and so you should suppliment whatever I write here with other documentation (I will not go into much detail about how git actually works.)

1. Initlialise a git repository

Open a terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows) and change directory ("cd") to the folder that contains the files you want to 'version control' and initlialise a new git repository: 

.. code-block :: shell
    cd ~\example-project
    git init
